Homework 1.
Jeron A. - JavaScript
Chris C. - Lua
Isaiah P. - Python

Description: The purpose of this assignment is to get familiar with the syntax and objects available within popular languages including Lua, JavaScript, and Python. We were tasked with building 4 functions and a Quaternion Class.

Homework 2.
Jeron A., Isaiah P. - Kotlin
Chris C., Isaiah P. - Java
Elijah S., Isaiah P. - Swift

Description: The purpose of this assignment is to get familiar with the syntax and objects available within popular languages including Java, Kotlin, and Swift. We were tasked with building 3 functions, a Quaternion Class, and a Binary Search Tree.

Homework 3.
Jeron A. - TypeScript
Isaiah P., Chris C. - Haskell
Elijah S. - OCaml

Description: The purpose of this assignment is to get familiar with the syntax and objects available within popular languages including TypeScript, Haskell, and OCaml. We were tasked with building 5 functions and implementing a persistent Binary Search Tree with information hiding.

Homework 4.
Jeron A. - C
Chris C. - C++
Isaiah P. - Rust

Description: The purpose of this assignment is to implement a user-defined stack data structure in C, C++, and Rust. For C, the stack stores strings; for C++ and Rust, the stack is generic. In C and C++, the stack uses manually-managed arrays following best practices for information hiding. In Rust, the stack wraps a vector, leveraging its built-in resizing behavior.
